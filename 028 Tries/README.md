# TRIE Implementation:

*Efficient* Re-__trie__-val of information

R[problem_no] --> Remedial Class problems

First refer [Binary tree implementation using 2d array](https://github.com/FazeelUsmani/Scaler-Academy/blob/master/028%20Tries/BinaryTree2dArray.cpp), likewise, we're going to use this 2d matrix to represent nodes in trie to save memory and avoid MLE (Memory Overflow Error)

In the above image you can look how the matrix looks after inserting 10, 6, 2, 18, 19, 15 in the BST.
By implementing trie in such manner helps you to process the trie earlier and also the dynamic allocation is too slow to process.

Refer [01 TRIE_best](https://github.com/FazeelUsmani/Scaler-Academy/blob/master/028%20Tries/01%20TRIE_best.cpp) for the fastest implementation of TRIE
