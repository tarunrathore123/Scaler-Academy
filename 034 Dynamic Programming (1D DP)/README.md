## Dynamic Programming:


There are around 8 patterns of Dynamic Programming: [Read it here](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/458695/Dynamic-Programming-Patterns). This may help you to gain some insignts to identify a problem which can be solved using DP. I know it comes after practice but this will definitely help. 

We can also do [HW4 Maximumsum](https://github.com/FazeelUsmani/Scaler-Academy/blob/master/034%20Dynamic%20Programming%20(1D%20DP)/HW4%20MaximumSum.cpp) by creating [left and right max arrays](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-array-three-numbers-maximize-x-ai-y-aj-z-ak/) by which we can achieve O(N) space complexity. Big O notation is same but space is optimized a bit from 3*N --> N

Here is the code: [[optimized] HW4 MaximumSum](https://github.com/FazeelUsmani/Scaler-Academy/blob/master/034%20Dynamic%20Programming%20(1D%20DP)/HW4%20maximumSum1.cpp)

But this approach fails when we have more than 3 integers i.e. (B, C, D, E, F....). So, its better to have a look at both of them
